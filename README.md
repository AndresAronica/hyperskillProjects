Hi, welcome!
In this repo I will keep my already solved HyperSkill Projects, from the JetBrains Academy in the Java Developer track.
The idea behind this is to:
- Keep learning new skills, becoming a better Java developer,
- Learning new ways to solve different kinds of problems,
- Learn how to use git in the best way possible!
- Being able to consolidate the theoretical study included in the course, in the best way possible: By practicing!

This repo is ordered in a simple way. There is going to be a package for every difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Challenging)
Inside each package, there is going to be one package per project. The easier ones only have one class inside, but as they get harder and harder, I will need to mantain the order in the different classes.

Important note: There are some cases in which the solutions could be better, but in the course you have to pass some automated tests, and in some cases they can be a little weird, so you need to accommodate to some random requests.

But, in case you feel that I can improve my solutions in some way, I encourage you to let me know, so I can keep learning!

In case you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to help you! You have my contact details in my profile.

Thanks for stopping by!
